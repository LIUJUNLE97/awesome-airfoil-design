abstract = {An objective of mechanical design is to obtain a shape that satisfies specific requirements. In the present work, we achieve this goal using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE). The method enables us to analyze the relationship between aerodynamic performance and the shape of aerodynamic parts, and to explore new designs for the parts. In the CVAE model, a shape is fed as an input and the corresponding aerodynamic performance index is fed as a continuous label. Then, shapes are generated by specifying the continuous label and latent vector. When CVAE is applied to mechanical design, it is desired to draw shapes that reproduce the specified aerodynamic performance. In ordinal CVAE, the model is trained to minimize reconstruction loss and latent loss, and it is usually optimized considering the sum of these losses. However, the present study shows that the optimal network is not always optimal in terms of reproducing the aerodynamic performance. The proposed method is verified using two numerical examples: a two-dimensional (2D) airfoil and a turbine blade. In the airfoil example, we demonstrate the effects of latent dimension, and in the turbine design example, we demonstrate that the proposed method can be applied to a real turbine design problem and reduce the design time.},
